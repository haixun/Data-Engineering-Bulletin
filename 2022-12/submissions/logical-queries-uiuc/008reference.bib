abstract = {Reasoning is a fundamental capability for harnessing valuable insight, knowledge and patterns from knowledge graphs. Existing work has primarily been focusing on point-wise reasoning, including search, link prediction, entity prediction, subgraph matching and so on. This paper introduces comparative reasoning over knowledge graphs, which aims to infer the commonality and inconsistency with respect to multiple pieces of clues. We envision that the comparative reasoning will complement and expand the existing point-wise reasoning over knowledge graphs. In detail, we develop KompaRe, the first of its kind prototype system that provides comparative reasoning capability over large knowledge graphs. We present both the system architecture and its core algorithms, including knowledge segment extraction, pairwise reasoning and collective reasoning. Empirical evaluations demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed KompaRe.},

abstract = {Representing discrete words in a continuous vector space turns out to be useful for natural language applications related to text understanding. Meanwhile, it poses extensive challenges, one of which is due to the polysemous nature of human language. A common solution (a.k.a word sense induction) is to separate each word into multiple senses and create a representation for each sense respectively. However, this approach is usually computationally expensive and prone to data sparsity, since each sense needs to be managed discriminatively. In this work, we propose a new framework for generating context-aware text representations without diving into the sense space. We model the concept space shared among senses, resulting in a framework that is efficient in both computation and storage. Specifically, the framework we propose is one that: i) projects both words and concepts into the same vector space; ii) obtains unambiguous word representations that not only preserve the uniqueness among words, but also reflect their context-appropriate meanings. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the framework in a number of tasks on text understanding, including word/phrase similaritymeasurements, paraphrase identification and question-answer relatedness classification.},

Knowledge graphs, as a new type of knowledge representation, have gained much attention in natural language processing. Knowledge graphs can effectively organize and represent knowledge so that it can be efficiently utilized in advanced applications. Recently, reasoning over knowledge graphs has become a hot research topic, since it can obtain new knowledge and conclusions from existing data. Herein we review the basic concept and definitions of knowledge reasoning and the methods for reasoning over knowledge graphs. Specifically, we dissect the reasoning methods into three categories: rule-based reasoning, distributed representation-based reasoning and neural network-based reasoning. We also review the related applications of knowledge graph reasoning, such as knowledge graph completion, question answering, and recommender systems. Finally, we discuss the remaining challenges and research opportunities for knowledge graph reasoning."

Knowledge graphs have been developed for use as a form of the knowledge base for words and general relationships among words. However, they have two limitations. One is that the knowledge graph is limited in size and scope for most of the human languages. Another is that they are not able to deal with neologisms that form a part of the human common sense. Addressing these problems, we have developed and validated PolarisX which can automatically expand a knowledge graph, by crawling and analyzing the news sites and social media in real-time. We utilize and fine-tune the pre-trained multilingual BERT model for the construction of knowledge graphs without language dependencies. We extract new relationships using the BERT-based relation extraction model and integrate them into the knowledge graph. We verify the novelty and accuracy of PolarisX. It deals with neologisms and does not have language dependencies."

    abstract = "Our goal is to combine the rich multi-step inference of symbolic logical reasoning with the generalization capabilities of neural networks. We are particularly interested in complex reasoning about entities and relations in text and large-scale knowledge bases (KBs). Neelakantan et al. (2015) use RNNs to compose the distributed semantics of multi-hop paths in KBs; however for multiple reasons, the approach lacks accuracy and practicality. This paper proposes three significant modeling advances: (1) we learn to jointly reason about relations, \textit{entities, and entity-types}; (2) we use neural attentionmodeling to incorporate \textit{multiple paths}; (3) we learn to \textit{share strength in a single RNN} that represents logical composition across allrelations. On a large-scale Freebase+ClueWeb prediction task, we achieve 25{\%}error reduction, and a 53{\%} error reduction on sparse relations due to sharedstrength. On chains of reasoning in WordNet we reduce error in mean quantile by84{\%} versus previous state-of-the-art.",

abstract = {Multiple networks emerge in a wealth of high-impact applications. Network alignment, which aims to find the node correspondence across different networks, plays a fundamental role for many data mining tasks. Most of the existing methods can be divided into two categories: (1) consistency optimization based methods, which often explicitly assume the alignment to be consistent in terms of neighborhood topology and attribute across networks, and (2) network embedding based methods which learn low-dimensional node embedding vectors to infer alignment. In this paper, by analyzing representative methods of these two categories, we show that (1) the consistency optimization based methods are essentially specific random walk propagations from anchor links that might be too restrictive; (2) the embedding based methods no longer explicitly assume alignment consistency but inevitably suffer from the space disparity issue. To overcome these two limitations, we bridge these methods and propose a novel family of network alignment algorithms BRIGHT to handle both plain and attributed networks. Specifically, it constructs a space by random walk with restart (RWR) whose bases are one-hot encoding vectors of anchor nodes, followed by a shared linear layer. Our experiments on real-world networks show that the proposed family of algorithms BRIGHT outperform the state-of-the-arts for both plain and attributed network alignment tasks. },
