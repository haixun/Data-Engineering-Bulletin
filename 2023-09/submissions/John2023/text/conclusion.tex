\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}

We have designed and implemented \Hammer and \name to enhance the system efficiency of vector search. We have followed the state-of-the-art vector search algorithm, but at every level, we have introduced innovations that stretch prior methods and tailor our system for the newer hardware setting of multi-core processors and heterogeneous memory. 
Our innovations, such as intra-query path-wise parallelism, staged expansion, redundancy-aware synchronization, and HM-aware index construction, improve the computational and memory efficiency of large-scale vector search. Many of these methods should work well in other settings, such as SSD-based methods and compression-based indices. Finally, we propose several open research directions from a system perspective that have the potential to further improve large-scale vector search. We hope these directions will inspire new research that can advance vector search and make it more efficient, robust, and easy-to-use.
