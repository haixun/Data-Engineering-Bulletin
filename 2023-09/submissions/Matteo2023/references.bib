  abstract = {Here we present Singularity, software developed to bring
              containers and reproducibility to scientific computing. Using
              Singularity containers, developers can work in reproducible
              environments of their choosing and design, and these complete
              environments can easily be copied and executed on other platforms.
              Singularity is an open source initiative that harnesses the
              expertise of system and software engineers and researchers alike,
              and integrates seamlessly into common workflows for both of these
              groups. As its primary use case, Singularity brings mobility of
              computing to both users and HPC centers, providing a secure means
              to capture and distribute software and compute environments. This
              ability to create and deploy reproducible environments across these
              centers, a previously unmet need, makes Singularity a game changing
              development for computational science.},
