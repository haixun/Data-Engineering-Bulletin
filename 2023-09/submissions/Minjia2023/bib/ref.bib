    abstract = {In applications ranging from image search to recommendation systems, the problem of identifying a set of "similar" real-valued vectors to a query vector plays a critical role. However, retrieving these vectors and computing the corresponding similarity scores from a large database is computationally challenging. Approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) search relaxes the guarantee of exactness for efficiency by vector compression and/or by only searching a subset of database vectors for each query. Searching a larger subset increases both accuracy and latency. State-of-the-art ANN approaches use fixed configurations that apply the same termination condition (the size of subset to search) for all queries, which leads to undesirably high latency when trying to achieve the last few percents of accuracy. We find that due to the index structures and the vector distributions, the number of database vectors that must be searched to find the ground-truth nearest neighbor varies widely among queries. Critically, we further identify that the intermediate search result after a certain amount of search is an important runtime feature that indicates how much more search should be performed. To achieve a better tradeoff between latency and accuracy, we propose a novel approach that adaptively determines search termination conditions for individual queries. To do so, we build and train gradient boosting decision tree models to learn and predict when to stop searching for a certain query. These models enable us to achieve the same accuracy with less total amount of search compared to the fixed configurations. We apply the learned adaptive early termination to state-of-the-art ANN approaches, and evaluate the end-to-end performance on three million to billion-scale datasets. Compared with fixed configurations, our approach consistently improves the average end-to-end latency by up to 7.1 times faster under the same high accuracy targets. Our approach is open source at github.com/efficient/faiss-learned-termination.},

    abstract = {Recently similarity graphs became the leading paradigm for efficient nearest neighbor search, outperforming traditional tree-based and LSH-based methods. Similarity graphs perform the search via greedy routing: a query traverses the graph and in each vertex moves to the adjacent vertex that is the closest to this query. In practice, similarity graphs are often susceptible to local minima, when queries do not reach its nearest neighbors, getting stuck in suboptimal vertices. In this paper we propose to learn the routing function that overcomes local minima via incorporating information about the graph global structure. In particular, we augment the vertices of a given graph with additional representations that are learned to provide the optimal routing from the start vertex to the query nearest neighbor. By thorough experiments, we demonstrate that the proposed learnable routing successfully diminishes the local minima problem and significantly improves the overall search performance.}

We fill this gap and rigorously analyze the performance of graph-based NNS algorithms, specifically focusing on the low-dimensional ($d \ll \log n$) regime. In addition to the basic greedy algorithm on nearest neighbor graphs, we also analyze the most successful heuristics commonly used in practice: speeding up via adding shortcut edges and improving accuracy via maintaining a dynamic list of candidates. We believe that our theoretical insights supported by experimental analysis are an important step towards understanding the limits and benefits of graph-based NNS algorithms.}

We also introduce a multiprobe version of this algorithm and conduct an experimental evaluation on real and synthetic data sets.We complement the above positive results with a fine-grained lower bound for the quality of any LSH family for angular distance. Our lower bound implies that the above LSH family exhibits a trade-off between evaluation time and quality that is close to optimal for a natural class of LSH functions.},

In this paper, we argue that existing DSLs can be implemented on top of a general-purpose infrastructure that (i) supports very fine-grain tasks, (ii) implements autonomous, speculative execution of these tasks, and (iii) allows application-specific control of task scheduling policies. To support this claim, we describe such an implementation called the Galois system.We demonstrate the capabilities of this infrastructure in three ways. First, we implement more sophisticated algorithms for some of the graph analytics problems tackled by previous DSLs and show that end-to-end performance can be improved by orders of magnitude even on power-law graphs, thanks to the better algorithms facilitated by a more general programming model. Second, we show that, even when an algorithm can be expressed in existing DSLs, the implementation of that algorithm in the more general system can be orders of magnitude faster when the input graphs are road networks and similar graphs with high diameter, thanks to more sophisticated scheduling. Third, we implement the APIs of three existing graph DSLs on top of the common infrastructure in a few hundred lines of code and show that even for power-law graphs, the performance of the resulting implementations often exceeds that of the original DSL systems, thanks to the lightweight infrastructure.},

    abstract = {There has been significant recent interest in parallel frameworks for processing graphs due to their applicability in studying social networks, the Web graph, networks in biology, and unstructured meshes in scientific simulation. Due to the desire to process large graphs, these systems have emphasized the ability to run on distributed memory machines. Today, however, a single multicore server can support more than a terabyte of memory, which can fit graphs with tens or even hundreds of billions of edges. Furthermore, for graph algorithms, shared-memory multicores are generally significantly more efficient on a per core, per dollar, and per joule basis than distributed memory systems, and shared-memory algorithms tend to be simpler than their distributed counterparts.In this paper, we present a lightweight graph processing framework that is specific for shared-memory parallel/multicore machines, which makes graph traversal algorithms easy to write. The framework has two very simple routines, one for mapping over edges and one for mapping over vertices. Our routines can be applied to any subset of the vertices, which makes the framework useful for many graph traversal algorithms that operate on subsets of the vertices. Based on recent ideas used in a very fast algorithm for breadth-first search (BFS), our routines automatically adapt to the density of vertex sets. We implement several algorithms in this framework, including BFS, graph radii estimation, graph connectivity, betweenness centrality, PageRank and single-source shortest paths. Our algorithms expressed using this framework are very simple and concise, and perform almost as well as highly optimized code. Furthermore, they get good speedups on a 40-core machine and are significantly more efficient than previously reported results using graph frameworks on machines with many more cores.},

    abstract = { Graph-structured analytics has been widely adopted in a number of big data applications such as social computation, web-search and recommendation systems. Though much prior research focuses on scaling graph-analytics on distributed environments, the strong desire on performance per core, dollar and joule has generated considerable interests of processing large-scale graphs on a single server-class machine, which may have several terabytes of RAM and 80 or more cores. However, prior graph-analytics systems are largely neutral to NUMA characteristics and thus have suboptimal performance. This paper presents a detailed study of NUMA characteristics and their impact on the efficiency of graph-analytics. Our study uncovers two insights: 1) either random or interleaved allocation of graph data will significantly hamper data locality and parallelism; 2) sequential inter-node (i.e., remote) memory accesses have much higher bandwidth than both intra- and inter-node random ones. Based on them, this paper describes Polymer, a NUMA-aware graph-analytics system on multicore with two key design decisions. First, Polymer differentially allocates and places topology data, application-defined data and mutable runtime states of a graph system according to their access patterns to minimize remote accesses. Second, for some remaining random accesses, Polymer carefully converts random remote accesses into sequential remote accesses, by using lightweight replication of vertices across NUMA nodes. To improve load balance and vertex convergence, Polymer is further built with a hierarchical barrier to boost parallelism and locality, an edge-oriented balanced partitioning for skewed graphs, and adaptive data structures according to the proportion of active vertices. A detailed evaluation on an 80-core machine shows that Polymer often outperforms the state-of-the-art single-machine graph-analytics systems, including Ligra, X-Stream and Galois, for a set of popular real-world and synthetic graphs. },

    abstract = {We investigate how graph partitioning adversely affects the performance of graph analytics. We demonstrate that graph partitioning induces extra work during graph traversal and that graph partitions have markedly different connectivity than the original graph. By consequence, increasing the number of partitions reaches a tipping point after which overheads quickly dominate performance gains. Moreover, we show that the heuristic to balance CPU load between graph partitions by balancing the number of edges is inappropriate for a range of graph analyses. However, even when it is appropriate, it is sub-optimal due to the skewed degree distribution of social networks. Based on these observations, we propose GraphGrind, a new graph analytics system that addresses the limitations incurred by graph partitioning. We moreover propose a NUMA-aware extension to the Cilk programming language and obtain a scale-free yet NUMA-aware parallel programming environment which underpins NUMA-aware scheduling in GraphGrind. We demonstrate that Graph-Grind outperforms state-of-the-art graph analytics systems for shared memory including Ligra, Polymer and Galois.},

This paper introduces a new priority-based extension to GraphIt, a domain-specific language for writing graph applications, to simplify writing high-performance parallel ordered graph algorithms. The extension enables vertices to be processed in a dynamic order while hiding low-level implementation details from the user. We extend the compiler with new program analyses, transformations, and code generation to produce fast implementations of ordered parallel graph algorithms. We also introduce bucket fusion, a new performance optimization that fuses together different rounds of ordered algorithms to reduce synchronization overhead, resulting in 1.2\texttimes{}â€“3\texttimes{} speedup over the fastest existing ordered algorithm implementations on road networks with large diameters. With the extension, GraphIt achieves up to 3\texttimes{} speedup on six ordered graph algorithms over state-of-the-art frameworks and hand-optimized implementations (Julienne, Galois, and GAPBS) that support ordered algorithms.},

Vectorization has been applied to graph processing, where the graph is traversed either in a push style or a pull style.

This paper is the first to present a general solution to vectorizing push style traversal. It more-over presents an enhanced vectorized pull style traversal.Our solution consists of three components: CleanCut, a graph partitioning approach that rules out inter-thread race conditions; VectorFast, a compact graph representation that supports fast-forwarding through the edge stream; and Graptor, a domain-specific language and compiler for auto-vectorizing and optimizing graph processing codes.Experimental evaluation demonstrates average speedups of 2.72X over Ligra, 2.46X over GraphGrind, and 2.33X over GraphIt.

The scale of these graphs - in some cases billions of vertices, trillions of edges - poses challenges to their efficient processing. In this paper we present a computational model suitable for this task. Programs are expressed as a sequence of iterations, in each of which a vertex can receive messages sent in the previous iteration, send messages to other vertices, and modify its own state and that of its outgoing edges or mutate graph topology. This vertex-centric approach is flexible enough to express a broad set of algorithms. The model has been designed for efficient, scalable and fault-tolerant implementation on clusters of thousands of commodity computers, and its implied synchronicity makes reasoning about programs easier. Distribution-related details are hidden behind an abstract API. The result is a framework for processing large graphs that is expressive and easy to program.},

While retaining the scatter-gather programming model with state stored in the vertices, X-Stream is novel in (i) using an edge-centric rather than a vertex-centric implementation of this model, and (ii) streaming completely unordered edge lists rather than performing random access. This design is motivated by the fact that sequential bandwidth for all storage media (main memory, SSD, and magnetic disk) is substantially larger than random access bandwidth.We demonstrate that a large number of graph algorithms can be expressed using the edge-centric scatter-gather model. The resulting implementations scale well in terms of number of cores, in terms of number of I/O devices, and across different storage media. X-Stream competes favorably with existing systems for graph processing. Besides sequential access, we identify as one of the main contributors to better performance the fact that X-Stream does not need to sort edge lists during preprocessing.},

    abstract = {Vertex-centric graph processing is employed by many popular algorithms (e.g., PageRank) due to its simplicity and efficient use of asynchronous parallelism. The high compute power provided by SIMT architecture presents an opportunity for accelerating these algorithms using GPUs. Prior works of graph processing on a GPU employ Compressed Sparse Row (CSR) form for its space-efficiency; however, CSR suffers from irregular memory accesses and GPU underutilization that limit its performance. In this paper, we present CuSha, a CUDA-based graph processing framework that overcomes the above obstacle via use of two novel graph representations: G-Shards and Concatenated Windows (CW). G-Shards uses a concept recently introduced for non-GPU systems that organizes a graph into autonomous sets of ordered edges called shards. CuSha's mapping of GPU hardware resources on to shards allows fully coalesced memory accesses. CW is a novel representation that enhances the use of shards to achieve higher GPU utilization for processing sparse graphs. Finally, CuSha fully utilizes the GPU power by processing multiple shards in parallel on GPU's streaming multiprocessors. For ease of programming, CuSha allows the user to define the vertex-centric computation and plug it into its framework for parallel processing of large graphs. Our experiments show that CuSha provides significant speedups over the state-of-the-art CSR-based virtual warp-centric method for processing graphs on GPUs.},

"Gunrock," our high-level bulk-synchronous graph-processing system targeting the GPU, takes a new approach to abstracting GPU graph analytics: rather than designing an abstraction around computation, Gunrock instead implements a novel data-centric abstraction centered on operations on a vertex or edge frontier. Gunrock achieves a balance between performance and expressiveness by coupling high-performance GPU computing primitives and optimization strategies with a high-level programming model that allows programmers to quickly develop new graph primitives with small code size and minimal GPU programming knowledge. We evaluate Gunrock on five graph primitives (BFS, BC, SSSP, CC, and PageRank) and show that Gunrock has on average at least an order of magnitude speedup over Boost and PowerGraph, comparable performance to the fastest GPU hardwired primitives, and better performance than any other GPU high-level graph library.},

	abstract = {Systems as diverse as genetic networks or the World Wide Web are best described as networks with complex topology. A common property of many large networks is that the vertex connectivities follow a scale-free power-law distribution. This feature was found to be a consequence of two generic mechanisms: (i) networks expand continuously by the addition of new vertices, and (ii) new vertices attach preferentially to sites that are already well connected. A model based on these two ingredients reproduces the observed stationary scale-free distributions, which indicates that the development of large networks is governed by robust self-organizing phenomena that go beyond the particulars of the individual systems.},
