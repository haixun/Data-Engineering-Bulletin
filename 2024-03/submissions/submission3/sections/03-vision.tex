\section{Towards Data Traceability for Responsible AI}
\label{sec:vision}


In this paper, we develop a technical, data-centric vision to work towards a comparable level of safety in AI/ML applications as the FDA has in combatting foodborne illnesses. Unfortunately, the current state of AI/ML safety in the industry is dire, as practitioners from the aforementioned industry survey~\cite{holstein2019improving} report that ``teams do not discover serious fairness issues until they receive customer complaints about products'' or read ``negative media coverage about their products'', and more than half of the respondents agreed that they ``discovered serious issues only after deploying a system in the real world''. While this survey paper identifies many crucial issues in this space, it unfortunately falls short of outlining concrete technical directions for addressing them. 

In the following, we outline our ideas for improving the safety of AI/ML applications. Inspired by the existing methods and processes for combatting foodborne illnesses from \Cref{sec:inspiration}, we propose ideas on ``detecting outbreaks'' via prediction monitoring in \Cref{sec:vision-monitoring}, for conducting ``traceback investigations'' through data supply chains in \Cref{sec:vision-tracing}, and for identifying ``contaminated data and pipeline steps'' through audits in \Cref{sec:vision-audit}.
