\section{Conclusion}

We took a detailed look at how the FDA detects outbreaks of foodborne illnesses via their PulseNet database, discovers the contaminated food with disease detectives, and conducts traceback investigations through the food supply chain to determine the root cause of the contamination and issue a comprehensive product recall~(\Cref{sec:inspiration}).

Inspired by the FDA's processes, we developed a technical data-centric vision for responsible AI, which centers around prediction monitoring, data tracing through end-to-end AI/ML applications, and identifying contaminated data and pipeline steps through audits. For each of these aspects, we outlined technical research ideas, reviewed related work, and discussed challenges and open questions.

We hope that our ideas can positively influence the development of safer AI/ML applications, especially in the high-risk areas outlined by recent regulation such as the upcoming EU AI act.
