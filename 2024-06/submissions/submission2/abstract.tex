Differential privacy (DP) offers a robust framework for protecting individual privacy when analyzing data. However, the elegant abstractions used in DP theory do not always translate seamlessly to real-world systems. For example, the basic DP system maintains a global privacy budget and updates it when it answers a query. However, tracking this level of privacy information cannot character the privacy loss for heterogeneous data types, complex DP mechanisms, or the privacy loss towards different data analysts. Several DP systems have shown success by tracking more fine-grained information about privacy usage. Inspired by this, we propose a novel perspective: leveraging fine-grained privacy provenance to build practical DP systems. First, we propose a taxonomy of privacy provenance for DP, including why-, how-, and where-DP-provenance that characterizes different aspects of DP. Next, we review several systems that feature different techniques in each category of privacy provenance.
Through this unique lens, we summarize the open challenges for DP systems and future directions for deeper integration between DP and data provenance techniques.
