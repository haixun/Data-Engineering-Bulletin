\section{Conclusion}
This article explores how provenance techniques can empower differential privacy (DP) systems. We introduce a novel taxonomy for three crucial DP provenance types (why-provenance, how-provenance, and where-provenance).  We then unpack existing techniques for each type, leveraging case studies to illuminate their advantages and drawbacks. Finally, we establish the link between fine-grained DP provenance and traditional data provenance, investigating how both can propel advancements in DP across various domains. This work is the first attempt to bridge these two critical areas. We hope it offers a unique perspective and paves the way for further research in this exciting direction.
