\begin{abstract}
Time series are extensively used in finance, healthcare, IoT, and smart cities. However, in many applications, time series often contain personal information, so releasing them publicly can pose privacy risks. Differential privacy has recently emerged as the state-of-the-art approach for safeguarding data privacy. Unfortunately, adapting differential privacy to time series presents unique challenges compared to other data types due to their large volume, temporal correlations, and dynamic nature. To address users' demands for time series analysis while simultaneously protecting privacy, a significant body of research works have been proposed. The aim of this survey is to summarize these works and provide a holistic view of the DP mechanisms under differential privacy. Furthermore, we will discuss the challenges associated with time series release, especially in one of its most prevalent applications --- location based services. Finally, we will explore open challenges and shed light on directions for future research.
