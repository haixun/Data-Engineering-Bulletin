    \caption{QA examples from WiTQA with predictions of varying popularity of question entity and entity-relation pair. The predictions from LM (GPT-3.5) with no augmentation and RALM (GPT-3.5+BM25) are shown. In the top row, both LM and RALM provide correct answers for the popular question. In the middle row, LM generates correct answer but RALM provides incorrect answer due to retrieval errors. In the bottom row, LM provides incorrect answer for an infrequent entity-relation pair.
