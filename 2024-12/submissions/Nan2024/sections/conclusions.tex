\section{Concluding Remarks}
\label{sec:conclusion}

In conclusion, \sys represents a significant advancement in the pursuit of trustworthy question answering over multimodal data lakes. By harnessing the power of RAG, \sys effectively addresses the critical challenge of hallucinations inherent in LLMs. Its dual functionality caters to diverse user needs, facilitating both reasoning and verification processes. Through the decomposition of complex queries and the retrieval of relevant information from various data sources, \sys generates grounded answers that can be rigorously cross-checked against reliable datasets. This collaborative approach not only enhances the accuracy of responses but also fosters confidence in the decision-making processes that rely on such information. As we continue to explore the potential of multimodal data and LLMs, \sys stands out as a versatile tool that can adapt to a wide range of applications, paving the way for more reliable and informed use of LLMs in various domains.
