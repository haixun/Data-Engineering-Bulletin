\section{Problem Statement}
\label{sec:problem}

Given a multi-modal query \( Q \), which may consist of natural language text and/or visual data (e.g., \( Q = (T, V) \), where \( T \) represents the text and \( V \) represents visual data, such as an image), the system first retrieves a relevant set of data items \( D \subseteq L \) from a multi-modal data lake \( L \). The data lake \( L \) contains various types of data, including text, images, and tables. After retrieving the relevant data \( D \), the system applies reasoning, often leveraging large language models, to generate an answer \( A \).

To ensure the answerâ€™s accuracy and relevance, a verification process is conducted by cross-referencing the generated answer \( A \) with the relevant data \( D \). This verification is formalized as:
\(
\text{verify}(A, x) \to \{0, 1, 2\}, \quad \forall x \in D
\)
Here, each data instance \( x \in D \) is evaluated against the generated answer \( A \), with the result being a ternary value: 0 indicates that the answer is verified, 1 indicates it is refuted, and 2 indicates that the data instance is not related to the answer. This verification process ensures that the generated answer is consistent with the multi-modal data \( D \), thereby enhancing the robustness and reliability of the system's response.\yang{For Q1 and Q5}
