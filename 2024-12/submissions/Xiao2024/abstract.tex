The KDD Cup 2024 CRAG Challenge aims to provide a foundation for evaluating Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. RAG systems take natural language questions as input, decide whether and how to use the facilitating information such as web pages and mock Knowledge graphs, and return natural language answers. A good RAG system provides correct and useful answers to questions without bringing in hallucinated information. In this report, we describe the motivation for organizing this challenge, review the design for the benchmark and the competition, discuss observations from the submissions, and reflect the learnings from hosting the challenge.
