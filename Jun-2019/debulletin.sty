%% INTRODUCTION
%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% 
% This is a LaTeX package for the Bulletin of the Technical Committee on
% Data Engineering.  It is intended to be used with the article document
% class at 11pt, but it can probably be used with report and book classes
% and other font sizes as well.
% The expected format of the bulletin is
% 
% 1. A cover.  This includes:
%    - a front cover page with the title, date, volume, and number of 
%      the issue, and with the table of contents
%    - an inside cover page giving the names of the editors and committee 
%      members, and other information
%    - an inside back cover that is blank
%    - a back cover that is blank, except for the IEEE mailing address and
%      the postage permit just below the fold half way down the page.
% 2. A few miscellaneous columns, probably from the editor of the special
%    issue and an overview of the area covered by the special issue.
% 3. A few letters to the editor.
% 4. The contributed articles
% 5. A few calls for papers for coming conference.
% 
% An example of how such an issue is as follows.
% Note that there are several formatting paramters, and they are described
% at the end of this file.

%% Table of Contents
%%
%% This is the hardest part of the style file.  The following
%% commands are used to generate the table of contents on the front
%% cover.  Most of the table of contents will be generated automatically
%% by environments like the letter and article environments below, but
%% the editor will want to insert some lines into the table of contents
%% by hand.  The following commands are provided:
%% 
%% \tocrule: 
%%   to generate a solid line to separate sections of the TOC
%% \tocskip{SKIP}:
%%   to insert a vertical skip of SKIP as in \tocskip{1in}
%% \tocheading{TITLE}: 
%% \tocsubheading{TITLE}: 
%% \tocsubsubheading{TITLE}: 
%%   to generate a section heading in the TOC, and more generally to 
%%   insert an arbitrary paragraph of text into the TOC.  Subheadings
%%   and subsubheadings are indented by \tocindention.
%% \tocentry{TITLE}{AUTHOR}:
%% \tocsubentry{TITLE}{AUTHOR}:
%% \tocsubsubentry{TITLE}{AUTHOR}:
%%   to generate an entry of the form ``AUTHOR .... TITLE page'' in the
%%   TOC for something like an article, etc, where page is the current 
%%   page number.  Again, subentries and subsubentries are indented.
%% 
%% There are also some lower level commands used to implement these command,
%% but an editor should never have to use them.
%% 
%% ONE CAVEAT: The arguments to all these commands are moving
%% arguments, so you must \protect fragile commands like \bigskip
%% and \Large.  (See \protect in the LaTeX book.)  Use 
%% \tocheading{\protect\bigskip\protect\Huge Introduction} and not
%% \tocheading{\bigskip\Huge Introduction}
%%

%
% \tocheading{TITLE} generates a table of contents section heading
% TITLE without a page number, and \tocsubheading and \tocsubsubheading
% are similar.  It is intended to be used to generate headings for 
% sections in the table of contents, headings such as ``Letters to 
% the Editor'' or ``Contributed Articles'' or ``Calls for Papers''.

% \tocentry{TITLE}{AUTHOR} generates a table of contents entry for

% These commands are intended for use with \tocheading, etc., for structuring
% the table of contents.  For example, in an special issue the preface 
% letters from the journal editor and special issue editor might be 
% presented in an introduction section.  The introduction toc heading
% would be generated with \tocheading{Introduction}, and the toc entries for
% the two letters would be generated by 
% \tocsubentry{Special Issue Greetings}{Editor S. Issue} and
% \tocsubentry{My Thanks to Editor S. Issue}{Journal Editor}.

%
% \@TocWrite{LEVEL}{LINE} writes to the table of contents a (typically
% preformatted) entry LINE, after indenting the entry appropriately.
% The LEVEL is an integer 0, 1, 2, ... and gives the number of times
% that LINE should be indented by an amount given by \tocindention.
%
% This macro is tricky: it must indent all lines but the first by
% \toclhindent on the left, and it must indent all lines but the last
% by \tocrhindent on the left.  For example, an entry for an article
% with title TTT... and author AAA... and page number PPP must be typeset 
% like
% 
% TTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT
%     TTTTTTTTTTTT......................

% \@FormatTocEntry{TITLE}{AUTHOR}{PAGE} formats the TITLE, AUTHOR, and

% to the table of contents itself, and does not indent entries and section
% headings appropriately.  It is meant to be used with \outputtocentry.
% The width given by \tocpagenumwidth is the width of the box in which
% page numbers are typeset.
% 
% This macro is tricky: it must compute on its own whether there is enough
% space for both the title and author/page number on the same line.  If
% not, it must split the line between the title and the author/page
% number.  (See the example above under \@TocWrite.)
% The basic idea comes from the TeXbook on page 106.  The macro
% works as long as the list of authors does not require more than two
% complete lines of text to print (the title can be as long as you like).
% When the macro breaks, the author/page number is not flush right on the
% page.  I don't understand linebreaking enough to debug this.

%% Commands used to include the IEEE logo and the inside front and
%% back covers of the bulletin.  The postscript inclusion commands use
%% the epsfig package, which pays attention to the search path declared
%% with the \graphicspath.  The default value for epsfig is the current
%% directory, but since some postscript files like the IEEE logo are
%% going to be used over and over again with each issue, but you might
%% want to create a special directory like /udir/editor/ps to hold them
%% and use \graphicspath{{/udir/editor/ps/}}.  Notice the double set of 
%% curly braces, and see the documentation for the graphics package for
%% documentation of this command.
%% 
%% \insidefrontcover{filename.ps}
%% \insidebackcover{filename.ps}
%% \insidefrontcover[title]{filename.ps}
%% \insidebackcover[title]{filename.ps}
%% 
%%   Defines the name of the file containing the postscript for the inside
%%   front and back covers.  If the file filename.ps for the inside back
%%   cover is not defined with \insidebackcover{filename.ps}, for example, 
%%   then nothing is included for the inside back cover.  If the optional
%%   argument title is given, then the title appears in the table of
%%   contents.
%% 
%% \IEEElogo{filename.ps}
%% 
%%   Defines the name of the file containing the postscript for the IEEE logo.
%% 
%% \singlePSpage{filename.ps}
%% \evensinglePSpage{filename.ps}
%% \oddsinglePSpage{filename.ps}
%% 
%%   These are commands that the editor will probably never need to use,
%%   but they are used to implement including the inside front and back
%%   covers, so they might be useful on some occasion for a call for papers
%%   or something.  These commands assume that filename.ps contains
%%   postscript for a single page (like the inside front cover), and they
%%   insert this page in the LaTeX document.  I expect most people will be
%%   happy using \singlePSpage, but since the margins on even and odd numbered
%%   pages may be different in some documents, I've included 
%%   \evensinglePSpage and \oddsinglePSpage commands as well.
